SaveAnnotation #Bool variable to save the results .. probably this would change
name #Name for the file where we want to save the final annotation
ExpectedV # Those are the possible elements that I expect in my molecules #AtomicSubscripts
MassVec # Contains the exact masses for the elements that I want to take into account
Tres # m/z interval to consider when looking for the ions in the m/z difference in between the fragments
MinTres #Minimum intensity that I expect to explain with my annotation... better to update the name
error #the expected error for my m/z when looking for the different MS2
errorT #The error in the RT when lookinf for the MS2
MinInt # Threshold for a group to be considered as peak
NoiseInt # Threshold for a signal to be consider as noise
DischargeT # Maximum size of the confidence interval to tolerate
RelDis # The minimum contribution in intensity before considering a peak
MinPoints # Minimum number of point to consider when deffining a peak
alpha #alpha value for the t-student test
returnMat # return the matrix with all fragments that explain the difference between two fragments
